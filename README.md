Interesting problems I came across or thought of myself. Some are famous results that are interesting or unexpected. These are all known results, but many problems do not yet have proofs because I don't know of a satisfactory one yet. These problems/statements come in a few categories that may expand in the future:

+ Math
+ Statistics
+ Useful tricks and identities
+ Real world application problems
