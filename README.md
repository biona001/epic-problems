Interesting problems I came across or thought of myself. Some are famous results that are interesting or unexpected. Many problems does not come with proofs because I haven't came across a satisfactory one yet, but are otherwise known results. These problems/statements come in roughly 4 categories:

+ Math
+ Statistics
+ Useful tricks and identities
+ Real world application problems
